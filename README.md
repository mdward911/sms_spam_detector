# SMS Spam Classifier
This project contains an SMS Spam Classification app that uses machine learning to classify SMS messages as either "spam" or "not spam" (ham). The model is built using a linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) and is deployed using the Gradio library for easy interaction through a web interface.

## Overview
The SMS Spam Classifier leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to predict whether an SMS message is spam or not. The model uses the SMSSpamCollection dataset for training, which consists of labeled SMS messages. This app allows users to enter their own SMS messages and get predictions on whether they are spam or ham (non-spam).

### The application is built using:

Scikit-learn for machine learning model training.
Gradio for creating an interactive web interface.
Pandas for data manipulation.
